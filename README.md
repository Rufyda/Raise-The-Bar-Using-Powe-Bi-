I’m excited to share my project for the **Raise The Bar** challenge!  
This submission was created as part of the **Fabric QuickViz** initiative, where creativity, design, and data storytelling come together.

## 🎨 Design Approach

I designed this report using **Figma**, focusing on:

- Clean and modern UI/UX  
- Strong visual hierarchy  
- Smooth layout alignment  
- Consistent color palette  
- Storytelling-driven visual flow  

This challenge was a great opportunity to combine design tools with data visualization principles.

I truly enjoyed the process, learned new design techniques, and gained fresh perspectives from the community.

I wish the best of luck to everyone participating —
